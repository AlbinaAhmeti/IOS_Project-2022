Appointment

The project in the field of Mobile Device Programming is about doctor's appointments to remind the elderly.
This idea is due to the fact that the elderly often forget about the appointments they have to check with the doctor, where this app sends a notification on the date that the appointment is at an hour that it sets.

App design:
